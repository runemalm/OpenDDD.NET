OpenDDD.NET is an open-source framework for domain-driven design (DDD) development using C# and ASP.NET Core. It provides a set of powerful tools and abstractions to help developers build scalable, maintainable, and testable applications following the principles of DDD.

> **Note:** OpenDDD.NET is currently in a beta state as part of new major version 3. Use with caution in production environments.

‚≠ê Consider **starring** and/or **following** the project to stay updated with the latest developments.

## Key Features

- **Aggregates**: Define domain aggregates with clear boundaries and encapsulate domain logic within them.
- **Entities and Value Objects**: Create entities and value objects to represent domain concepts and ensure strong type safety.
- **Repositories**: Abstract away data access and enable persistence of domain objects.
- **Domain Events**: Facilitate communication between domain objects while maintaining loose coupling.
- **Integration Events**: Enable communication between bounded contexts in distributed systems.
- **Event Listeners**: Manage event listeners to handle domain and integration events for scalable, event-driven architectures.
- **Domain Services**: Encapsulate domain-specific operations that do not naturally belong to an entity or value object.
- **Application Services**: Use Action classes to coordinate the execution of domain logic in response to commands.
- **Infrastructure Services**: Provide implementations for technical concerns such as logging, email, or external integrations.
- **Transactional Outbox**: Ensure event consistency by persisting and publishing events as part of database transactions.

We're adhering to the key principles and building blocks of Domain-Driven Design.

## Supported Versions

- ASP.NET Core 8
- ASP.NET Core 9

## Getting Started

To get started with OpenDDD.NET, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install the NuGet package**: Use the NuGet package manager or the .NET CLI to add the OpenDDD.NET package to your project.

   ```bash
   dotnet add package OpenDDD.NET --prerelease
   ```

2. **Create a new project**: Create a new project in your editor or IDE of choice or use the command below.

   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi -n Bookstore
   ```

3. **Set up OpenDDD.NET**: Register OpenDDD services and middleware in your `Program.cs` file.

   ```csharp
   using OpenDDD.API.Extensions;

   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

   // Add OpenDDD services
   builder.Services.AddOpenDDD(builder.Configuration, options =>  
   {  
       options.UseInMemoryDatabase()    
              .UseInMemoryMessaging()
              .SetEventTopics(  
                 "Bookstore.Domain.{EventName}",  
                 "Bookstore.Interchange.{EventName}"  
              )
              .SetEventListenerGroup("Default")
              .EnableAutoRegistration();
   });

   var app = builder.Build();

   // Use OpenDDD Middleware
   app.UseOpenDDD();

   app.Run();
   ```

4. **Start building your application**: Utilize the power of OpenDDD.NET to build scalable and maintainable applications.

For detailed guides and examples, refer to the documentation.


## Documentation

The official [OpenDDD.NET Documentation](https://docs.openddd.net/) provides getting-started guide, examples, and configuration references to help you get started and make the most of the framework.  

## Sample Project

The `Bookstore` sample project demonstrates how to use OpenDDD.NET in a real-world scenario, including domain modeling, repositories, actions, and framework configuration. 

Explore the project in the repository: [Bookstore Sample Project](https://github.com/runemalm/OpenDDD.NET/tree/master/samples/Bookstore).
